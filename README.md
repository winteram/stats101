# stats101

This contains files to teach an introductory-level statistics course.  This was originally designed for business students, so may cover different material than other statistics courses.

Each week has slides for the lecture and R code to generate homeworks.

To generate homeworks / exams, run:

./HWmaker.sh **X** **N**

Where Week**X** is the week for which to create homeworks, and N is the number of homeworks to make.

Requirements: 
- bash
- R
- pdflatex
- Sweave
